# Crime Data ETL & Analysis Pipeline

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a professional **ETL pipeline** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** workflow using crime datasets from the **FBI NIBRS** system and the **Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)**.  

The goal is to:
- Design a reproducible **ETL pipeline** to process raw FBI + LA crime data.  
- Perform **data cleaning, standardization, and integration** across sources.  
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with clear insights and visualizations.  
- Deliver polished results for **portfolio and resume showcase**.
